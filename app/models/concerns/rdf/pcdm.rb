    term :AdministrativeSet,
         comment: %(
           An Administrative Set is a grouping of resources that an administrative unit is ultimately
           responsible for managing. The set itself helps to manage the items within it. An Object
           or Collection may be contained by only one AdministrativeSet.

         comment: %(
           A Collection is a group of resources. Collections have descriptive metadata, access metadata,
           and may links to works and/or collections. By default, member works and collections are an
           unordered set, but can be ordered using the ORE Proxy class.

    term :File,
         comment: %(
           A File is a sequence of binary data and is described by some accompanying metadata.
           The metadata typically includes at least basic technical metadata \(size, content type,
           modification date, etc.\), but can also include properties related to preservation,
           digitization process, provenance, etc. Files MUST be contained by exactly one Object.

    term :Object,
         comment: %(
           An Object is an intellectual entity, sometimes called a "work", "digital object", etc.
           Objects have descriptive metadata, access metadata, may contain files and other Objects as
           member "components". Each level of a work is therefore represented by an Object instance,
           and is capable of standing on its own, being linked to from Collections and other Objects.
           Member Objects can be ordered using the ORE Proxy class.
